## Overview

WorldOS is a conceptual framework for understanding and building systems that integrate digital technology with human experience at multiple layers. The project aims to create a comprehensive ecosystem that bridges the gap between technological rationality and human complexity.

## Architecture

WorldOS is structured in four interconnected layers:

### 1. World OS - Memory Layer
The foundational layer that stores and organizes all data about the world - physical, digital, and conceptual. This serves as the unified knowledge graph and data repository that other layers build upon.

**Key Components:**
- Universal knowledge graph mapping relationships between entities
- Sensor and IoT device integration for real-time data collection
- Comprehensive API for data querying and updates

### 2. Life OS - Interface for Living Creatures
The personal layer that provides tools and interfaces for individuals to navigate and interact with the world effectively.

**Key Components:**
- Personalized assistants tailored to individual needs and goals
- Tools for managing health, productivity, and personal growth
- User-friendly interfaces for interacting with the World OS memory layer
- Automatic cataloging of people, texts, and events encountered in daily life
- Comprehensive storage of authors, co-authors, and reviewers from all consumed content
- Storage of both raw prompts and synthesized data to preserve information lineage

### 3. Social OS - Social Automation Layer
Facilitates and optimizes social interactions and relationships between individuals and groups.

**Key Components:**
- Collaboration and communication platforms
- Social network and relationship management tools
- Conflict resolution and cooperation mechanisms
- Automatic tracking and organization of social relationships and interactions
- Mapping of all social verticals and network connections
- JTBD (Jobs To Be Done) framework integration for capturing social context and purpose

### 4. Hypersocial - Human-AI Translation Layer
Bridges the gap between human irrationality and AI rationality, enabling AI to understand the complexity of human behavior.

**Key Components:**
- Models of human psychology and behavior
- Frameworks for interpreting cultural and social norms
- World as arena: understanding territories, order/chaos, hierarchies
- Dopamine systems and human motivation modeling

## Meta-Prompts

Below are the original prompts that inspired and guided this project:

```
help me think about what world os will and should be

like shema is like this

world os -- memory layer

life os -- operating system (interface) for living creatures for the world

social os -- social aspect of life automation

hypersocial -- explaining irrational human world (world as arena of actions, as known and unknown territory, as order and chaos and hierarchy and dopamine system), to a rational orderly ai
